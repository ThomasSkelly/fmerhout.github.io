      <title>Quantitative Text Analysis of NSDAP Member Autobiographies</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Hoover Institution recently finished digitizing &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.hoover.org/news/newly-digitized-nazi-biograms-now-available&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;586 Nazi biograms collected by Theodore Abel&lt;/a&gt;, professor of sociology at Columbia University from 1929 to 1950. Abel gathered these documents a year after Hitler&amp;rsquo;s appointment as chancellor by setting up a contest offering 400 German marks &amp;ldquo;for the best personal life history of an adherent of the Hitler movement.&amp;rdquo; The collection which represents a sample of 2.5% of early NSDAP members forms the basis for Abel&amp;rsquo;s insightful book &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674952003&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Why Hitler Came Into Power&lt;/a&gt; published in 1938.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the increasing sophistication of quantitative text analysis coinciding with the public release of the collection, we are now presented with the opportunity to reanalyze these data with computational methods. Earlier applications of such methods already highlighted the value of these data to reveal the &lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1016/S0304-422X[99]00022-4&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;narrative structures of becoming and being a Nazi&lt;/a&gt;, but to leverage the full potential of new computational methods the complete collection needs to be converted into a machine readable format. To create these machine readable files, this project will use the optical character recognition software from the leader in the field ABBYY which is accessible through their cloud based &lt;a href=&#34;https://ocrsdk.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;ABBYY OCR SDK&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am excited to be given the opportunity to co-host a tutorial on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/cbail/textnets/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;textnets&lt;/a&gt; package for R at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://symposium.computationalsocialscience.eu/2018/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;2018 European Symposium Series on Societal Challenges&lt;/a&gt; with my amazing colleagues &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.taylorwhittenbrown.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Taylor Whitten Brown&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://marcusmann.net/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Marcus Mann&lt;/a&gt;. The symposium will take place in Cologne, Germany from December 5 to 7 with our workshop and many more scheduled for the first day of the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feel free to bookmark this post as we will be updating it as we finalize the details for the tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;

### Install with Git

Prerequisites:

* [Download and install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* [Download and install Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/#quick-install)

        git clone https://github.com/sourcethemes/academic-kickstart.git My_Website

    *Note that if you forked Academic Kickstart, the above command should be edited to clone your fork, i.e. replace `sourcethemes` with your GitHub username.*

3. Build your site by running the `hugo` command. Then [host it for free using Github Pages](https://georgecushen.com/create-your-website-with-hugo/) or Netlify (refer to the first installation method). Alternatively, copy the generated `public/` directory (by FTP, Rsync, etc.) to your production web server (such as a university&#39;s hosting service).

## Updating

Feel free to *star* the project on [Github](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/) to help keep track of updates and check out the [release notes](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/updates) prior to updating your site.

Before updating the framework, it is recommended to make a backup of your entire website directory (or at least your `themes/academic` directory) and record your current version number.

By default, Academic is installed as a Git submodule which can be updated by running the following command:

```bash
git submodule update --remote --merge
```
