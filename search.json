[{"authors":["Friedolin Merhout"],"categories":null,"content":" I am excited to announce that I will be co-organizing a partner site for the 2019 Summer Institute in Computational Social Science (SICSS) together with Alina Arseniev-Koehler and Jennie E. Brand in beautiful Southern California. SICSS-Los Angeles will run from Monday, June 17 to Friday, June 28, 2019 at the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA). Thanks to generous funding from the California Center for Population Research (CCPR) there is no cost to participate, and we will provide refreshments for all on-site days.\nThe purpose of the Summer Institute is to bring together graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and early career faculty interested in computational social science. The Summer Institute is open to both social scientists and data scientists, broadly conceived. In coordination with the main Summer Institute site at Princeton, we will cover topics ranging from text analysis and online field experiments to and digital data collection and ethics. The Los Angeles partner site will additionally add a site-specific focus on machine-learning methods for causal inference.\nApplications are open through April 14, 11:59 PM PST, to all interested individuals regardless of location. Details about eligibility and application procedures can be found here\nNB: We are in the process of finalizing the schedule and will post updates to the partner site website as they become available.\nGeneral info  organizers:  Friedolin Merhout Alina Arseniev-Koehler Jennie E.

We surveyed a large sample of Democrats and Republicans who visit Twitter at least three times each week about a range of social policy issues. One week later, we randomly assigned respondents to a treatment condition in which they were offered financial incentives to follow a Twitter bot for 1 month that exposed them to messages from those with opposing political ideologies (e.g., elected officials, opinion leaders, media organizations, and nonprofit groups). Respondents were resurveyed at the end of the month to measure the effect of this treatment, and at regular intervals throughout the study period to monitor treatment compliance. We find that Republicans who followed a liberal Twitter bot became substantially more conservative posttreatment. Democrats exhibited slight increases in liberal attitudes after following a conservative Twitter bot, although these effects are not statistically significant. Notwithstanding important limitations of our study, these findings have significant implications for the interdisciplinary literature on political polarization and the emerging field of computational social science.","tags":[],"title":"Exposure to opposing views on social media can increase political polarization","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The Hoover Institution recently finished digitizing 586 Nazi biograms collected by Theodore Abel, professor of sociology at Columbia University from 1929 to 1950.

The symposium will take place in Cologne, Germany from December 5 to 7 with our workshop and many more scheduled for the first day of the event.\nNB: This post describes the tentative schedule and will be updated as we finalize the details for the tutorial.\nGeneral info  organizers:  Friedolin Merhout Taylor W. Brown Marcus L. Mann  location:  Cologne. Details TBD.  date:  December 5, 2018.   Description The tutorial will introduce participants to a newly developed R package that leverages techniques from network analysis/graph theory to improve and innovate on approaches to automated text analysis. There is growing interest in automated detection of latent themes in large-scale, unstructured text data. While topic models have become a popular choice for such tasks, our alternative provides several significant advantages over these conventional \u0026ldquo;bag of words\u0026rdquo; models. Three distinct advantages of our network-based approach are: 1) the potential to apply the concept of triadic closure to identify the meaning of words, i.e. the meaning of any two connected words can be understood more accurately in the context of a third word; 2) the greater flexibility in document length compared to the generally required long texts for topic models, which is a significant advantage in an age where short social media messages are pervasive; and 3) the incorporation of recent advances in community detection, which provides an innovative way to group words and documents by leveraging clustering observed within networks.\nTutorial participants will acquire a robust understanding of the fundamentals of both automated text analysis and network analysis, and will be encouraged to explore how their combination can improve upon existing text analysis methods. The main objective of the tutorial will be to enable participants to apply textnets methods to their own research questions using our R package. In doing so, participants will develop the skills to tailor the existing functionality of the package to their particular needs. As a second objective and in the spirit of open science, participants will be introduced to the tools and given the opportunity to contribute to our open-source repository on Github–suggesting changes or extending the functionality of the package for the benefit of future users.\nSchedule The tentative structure of the tutorial will be as follows:\nIntroduction and motivation for the textnets package  What is automated text analysis, what are its applications, and what are its limitations?  History: Content analysis Methods: Topic models and word embeddings Limitations of current methods  What is network analysis and how can it address these limitations?

Yet, these community-level drivers are notoriously difficult to study because public opinion surveys provide biased measures of both prejudice and radicalization. We examine the relationship between anti-Muslim and pro-ISIS (Islamic State of Iraq and Syria) Internet searches in 3099 U.S. counties between 2014 and 2016 using instrumental variable models that control for various community-level factors associated with radicalization. We find that anti-Muslim searches are strongly associated with pro-ISIS searches—particularly in communities with high levels of poverty and ethnic homogeneity. Although more research is needed to verify the causal nature of this relationship, this finding suggests that minority groups may be more susceptible to radicalization if they experience discrimination in settings where they are isolated and therefore highly visible—or in communities where they compete with majority groups for limited financial resources. We evaluate the validity of our findings using several other data sources and discuss the implications of our findings for the study of terrorism and intergroup relations, as well as immigration and counterterrorism policies.","tags":[],"title":"Using Internet search data to examine the relationship between anti-Muslim and pro-ISIS sentiment in U.S. counties","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\u0026hellip;\n","date":1530136800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1530136800,"objectID":"18d05a63a1c8d7ed973cc51838494e41","permalink":"/privacy/","publishdate":"2018-06-28T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/privacy/","section":"","summary":"\u0026hellip;","tags":null,"title":"Privacy Policy","type":"page"}]
