[{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The Hoover Institution recently finished digitizing 586 Nazi biograms collected by Theodore Abel, professor of sociology at Columbia University from 1929 to 1950. Abel gathered these documents a year after Hitler\u0026rsquo;s appointment as chancellor by setting up a contest offering 400 German marks \u0026ldquo;for the best personal life history of an adherent of the Hitler movement.\u0026rdquo; The collection which represents a sample of 2.5% of early NSDAP members forms the basis for Abel\u0026rsquo;s insightful book Why Hitler Came Into Power published in 1938.\nWith the increasing sophistication of quantitative text analysis coinciding with the public release of the collection, we are now presented with the opportunity to reanalyze these data with computational methods. Earlier applications of such methods already highlighted the value of these data to reveal the narrative structures of becoming and being a Nazi, but to leverage the full potential of new computational methods the complete collection needs to be converted into a machine readable format. To create these machine readable files, this project will use the optical character recognition software from the leader in the field ABBYY which is accessible through their cloud based ABBYY OCR SDK.\n","date":1534910400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1534910400,"objectID":"8de4a22974e5988b290a5fe8130a9b2f","permalink":"/project/nazi-biograms/","publishdate":"2018-08-22T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/project/nazi-biograms/","section":"project","summary":"Analysis of Nazi biograms collected by Theodore Abel.","tags":["quantitative text analysis","textnets","Nazi biograms"],"title":"Quantitative Text Analysis of NSDAP Member Autobiographies","type":"project"},{"authors":["Friedolin Merhout"],"categories":null,"content":" I am excited to be given the opportunity to co-host a tutorial on the textnets package for R at the 2018 European Symposium Series on Societal Challenges with my amazing colleagues Taylor Brown and Marcus Mann. The symposium will take place in Cologne, Germany from December 5 to 7 with our workshop and many more scheduled for the first day of the event.\nNB: This post describes the tentative schedule and will be updated as we finalize the details for the tutorial.\nGeneral info  organizers:  Friedolin Merhout Taylor W. Brown Marcus L. Mann  location:  Cologne. Details TBD.  date:  December 5, 2018.   Description The tutorial will introduce participants to a newly developed R package that leverages techniques from network analysis/graph theory to improve and innovate on approaches to automated text analysis. There is growing interest in automated detection of latent themes in large-scale, unstructured text data. While topic models have become a popular choice for such tasks, our alternative provides several significant advantages over these conventional \u0026ldquo;bag of words\u0026rdquo; models. Three distinct advantages of our network-based approach are: 1) the potential to apply the concept of triadic closure to identify the meaning of words, i.e. the meaning of any two connected words can be understood more accurately in the context of a third word; 2) the greater flexibility in document length compared to the generally required long texts for topic models, which is a significant advantage in an age where short social media messages are pervasive; and 3) the incorporation of recent advances in community detection, which provides an innovative way to group words and documents by leveraging clustering observed within networks.\nTutorial participants will acquire a robust understanding of the fundamentals of both automated text analysis and network analysis, and will be encouraged to explore how their combination can improve upon existing text analysis methods. The main objective of the tutorial will be to enable participants to apply textnets methods to their own research questions using our R package. In doing so, participants will develop the skills to tailor the existing functionality of the package to their particular needs. As a second objective and in the spirit of open science, participants will be introduced to the tools and given the opportunity to contribute to our open-source repository on Github–suggesting changes or extending the functionality of the package for the benefit of future users.\nSchedule The tentative structure of the tutorial will be as follows:\nIntroduction and motivation for the textnets package  What is automated text analysis, what are its applications, and what are its limitations?  History: Content analysis Methods: Topic models and word embeddings Limitations of current methods  What is network analysis and how can it address these limitations?  Network analysis basics: nodes, edges, network measures Meaning from triadic relationships Lower threshold for required text lengths Two mode networks and their visual representation (documents connected by words and vice versa) Network measures \u0026amp; community detection Polar ties for opposing views on topic    Introduction of the package and example application  What is the textnets package, what are its functions and their arguments?  Input data format Preparing text data Creating text networks Visualizing text networks Interpreting text networks Measuring brokerage  The US gun debate on Twitter - a textnets application  Introduction of corpora of tweets Show preparation of tweets Identifying communities in Twitter account text network Identifying topics in communities    Hands-on example application and brainstorming application ideas  BYOData or try out textnets on a dataset we provide Small group discussions to identify promising applications  Concluding presentations and discussion  Present participant-generated text networks Discussion of brainstorming ideas Future textnets developments      ","date":1534910400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1535428800,"objectID":"e4ec681f72632bce8443594effed5cf4","permalink":"/post/textnets-tutorial/","publishdate":"2018-08-22T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/post/textnets-tutorial/","section":"post","summary":"Learn how to combine quantitative text analysis with graph theory in Cologne in December.","tags":["workshop","textnets","#eurocss"],"title":"textnets tutorial at #eurocss","type":"post"},{"authors":["CA Bail","F Merhout","P Ding"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1534824000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1534824000,"objectID":"1e3eecacfe860af70185d80d5e64bae9","permalink":"/publication/bail-merhout-ding-2018/","publishdate":"2018-08-21T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/bail-merhout-ding-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"Recent terrorist attacks by first- and second-generation immigrants in the United States and Europe indicate that radicalization may result from the failure of ethnic integration—or the rise of intergroup prejudice in communities where “home-grown” extremists are raised. Yet, these community-level drivers are notoriously difficult to study because public opinion surveys provide biased measures of both prejudice and radicalization. We examine the relationship between anti-Muslim and pro-ISIS (Islamic State of Iraq and Syria) Internet searches in 3099 U.S. counties between 2014 and 2016 using instrumental variable models that control for various community-level factors associated with radicalization. We find that anti-Muslim searches are strongly associated with pro-ISIS searches—particularly in communities with high levels of poverty and ethnic homogeneity. Although more research is needed to verify the causal nature of this relationship, this finding suggests that minority groups may be more susceptible to radicalization if they experience discrimination in settings where they are isolated and therefore highly visible—or in communities where they compete with majority groups for limited financial resources. We evaluate the validity of our findings using several other data sources and discuss the implications of our findings for the study of terrorism and intergroup relations, as well as immigration and counterterrorism policies.","tags":[],"title":"Using Internet search data to examine the relationship between anti-Muslim and pro-ISIS sentiment in U.S. counties","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\u0026hellip;\n","date":1530158400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1530158400,"objectID":"18d05a63a1c8d7ed973cc51838494e41","permalink":"/privacy/","publishdate":"2018-06-28T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/privacy/","section":"","summary":"\u0026hellip;","tags":null,"title":"Privacy Policy","type":"page"}]
