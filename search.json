[{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The Hoover Institution recently finished digitizing 586 Nazi biograms collected by Theodore Abel, professor of sociology at Columbia University from 1929 to 1950. Abel gathered these documents a year after Hitler\u0026rsquo;s appointment as chancellor by setting up a contest offering 400 German marks \u0026ldquo;for the best personal life history of an adherent of the Hitler movement.\u0026rdquo; The collection which represents a sample of 2.5% of early NSDAP members forms the basis for Abel\u0026rsquo;s insightful book Why Hitler Came Into Power published in 1938.\nWith the increasing sophistication of quantitative text analysis coinciding with the public release of the collection, we are now presented with the opportunity to reanalyze these data with computational methods. Earlier applications of such methods already highlighted the value of these data to reveal the narrative structures of becoming and being a Nazi, but to leverage the full potential of new computational methods the complete collection needs to be converted into a machine readable format. To create these machine readable files, this project will use the optical character recognition software from the leader in the field ABBYY which is accessible through their cloud based ABBYY OCR SDK.\n","date":1534910400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1534910400,"objectID":"8de4a22974e5988b290a5fe8130a9b2f","permalink":"/project/nazi-biograms/","publishdate":"2018-08-22T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/project/nazi-biograms/","section":"project","summary":"Analysis of Nazi biograms collected by Theodore Abel.","tags":["quantitative text analysis","textnets","Nazi biograms"],"title":"Quantitative Text Analysis of NSDAP Member Autobiographies","type":"project"},{"authors":["Friedolin Merhout"],"categories":null,"content":"I am excited to be given the opportunity to co-host a tutorial on the textnets package for R at the 2018 European Symposium Series on Societal Challenges with my amazing colleagues Taylor Whitten Brown and Marcus Mann.

Yet, these community-level drivers are notoriously difficult to study because public opinion surveys provide biased measures of both prejudice and radicalization. We examine the relationship between anti-Muslim and pro-ISIS (Islamic State of Iraq and Syria) Internet searches in 3099 U.S. counties between 2014 and 2016 using instrumental variable models that control for various community-level factors associated with radicalization. We find that anti-Muslim searches are strongly associated with pro-ISIS searches—particularly in communities with high levels of poverty and ethnic homogeneity. Although more research is needed to verify the causal nature of this relationship, this finding suggests that minority groups may be more susceptible to radicalization if they experience discrimination in settings where they are isolated and therefore highly visible—or in communities where they compete with majority groups for limited financial resources. We evaluate the validity of our findings using several other data sources and discuss the implications of our findings for the study of terrorism and intergroup relations, as well as immigration and counterterrorism policies.","tags":[],"title":"Using Internet search data to examine the relationship between anti-Muslim and pro-ISIS sentiment in U.S. counties","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\u0026hellip;\n","date":1530158400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1530158400,"objectID":"18d05a63a1c8d7ed973cc51838494e41","permalink":"/privacy/","publishdate":"2018-06-28T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/privacy/","section":"","summary":"\u0026hellip;","tags":null,"title":"Privacy Policy","type":"page"}]
